# Life Expectancy Analysis: A Linear Regression Tutorial 🌍🎓

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that serve as a tutorial for learning linear regression using a dataset on life expectancy across different countries. The tutorial includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and feature selection. 

## Dataset 📊

The data used in this tutorial is sourced from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and is available on Kaggle. You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?resource=download).

## Notebooks 📓

1. **1_life_expectancy_EDA.ipynb** 📊
    - This notebook contains the initial exploratory data analysis. We dive into the dataset, visualize it, and understand the patterns and relationships in the data.

2. **1_life_expectancy_regression_model.ipynb** 🧮
    - In this notebook, we create our first regression model. We use Ridge Regression, a technique that helps us deal with multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. 

3. **2_life_expectancy_regression_model.ipynb** 🧮
    - This notebook contains an updated version of our regression model. We experiment with different models and parameters to improve our predictions.

4. **3_life_expectancy_feature_selection.ipynb** 🎯
    - In this notebook, we focus on feature selection. We use techniques like Lasso and Elastic Net regression, which not only help prevent overfitting but also make our model simpler and more interpretable by reducing the number of features.
