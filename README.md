# Life Expectancy Analysis: A Linear Regression Tutorial 🌍🎓

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that serve as a tutorial for learning linear regression using a dataset on life expectancy across different countries. The tutorial includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and feature selection. 

## Notebooks 📓

1. **1_life_expectancy_EDA.ipynb** 📊
    - This notebook contains the initial exploratory data analysis. We dive into the dataset, visualize it, and understand the patterns and relationships in the data.

3. **2_life_expectancy_regression_model.ipynb** 🧮
    - In this notebook, we create our first regression model with two different libraries, and learn how we can evaluate the predictions.

4. **3_life_expectancy_feature_selection.ipynb** 🎯
    - In this notebook, we focus on feature selection. We use techniques such as backward elimination and forward selection and progress to techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression, which not only help prevent overfitting but also make our model simpler and more interpretable by reducing the number of features.
